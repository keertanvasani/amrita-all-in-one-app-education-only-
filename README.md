📘 AUMS – Amrita University Management System
An Enhanced & Scalable Academic Management Platform
🏫 About AUMS

AUMS (Amrita University Management System) is a centralized academic management platform designed for Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham.
This project proposes a modernized and optimized implementation of AUMS, addressing usability, scalability, and performance limitations in the existing system.

The system provides a single unified interface for managing academic activities such as course registration, assignment submissions, attendance tracking, examination results, fee payments, and library services.

🎯 Objective

The primary objective of this project is to:

Improve assignment submission handling under high load

Provide real-time attendance and result visibility

Integrate library management within the academic portal

Enhance UI/UX for students and faculty

Build a scalable backend capable of supporting thousands of concurrent users

⚠️ Limitations of Existing AUMS

Assignment uploads fail during peak submission times

No centralized view of attendance, quizzes, and results

Library services are loosely integrated or external

Limited real-time updates and notifications

UI is not optimized for responsiveness and accessibility
